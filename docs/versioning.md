# Versioning

IMPulse uses version numbers like **`v1.0.2`** where

- **`1`** is major version. It is increased only when user **should** do manual operations to update
- **`0`** is minor version. It is increased when added new features / many changes.
- **`2`** is bugfix. It is increased when minimal code changes
